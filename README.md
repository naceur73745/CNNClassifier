# CNNClassifier
In my project, I implemented a CNN classifier using the PyTorch library to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

To start, I imported the necessary libraries, including PyTorch, torchvision, and numpy. PyTorch provides a wide range of tools and functions for building and training neural networks, while torchvision offers convenient access to popular datasets like CIFAR-10.

Next, I defined the architecture of my CNN classifier. It consisted of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and finally, fully connected layers to perform classification. Each convolutional layer used a specific number of filters with defined kernel sizes and activation functions such as ReLU to introduce non-linearity.

Once the architecture was defined, I loaded the CIFAR-10 dataset using torchvision's built-in functions. This allowed me to easily download and preprocess the data for training and testing. I performed standard data augmentation techniques like random flipping and cropping to improve generalization.

I split the dataset into training and testing sets, using around 80% of the images for training and the remaining 20% for evaluation. Then, I created data loaders to efficiently load the data in batches during the training process.

Moving on to training, I used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a specific learning rate and momentum. I defined a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss, to measure the error between predicted and actual class labels. During training, I iterated over the training set, passing batches of images through the network, computing the loss, and adjusting the network's parameters using backpropagation.

To monitor the training progress, I calculated the accuracy on the training set and validation set after each epoch. This allowed me to observe the model's performance and make necessary adjustments, such as tuning hyperparameters or applying regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay.

Once the model was trained, I evaluated its performance on the test set. I passed the test images through the trained network and calculated the accuracy to measure how well the model generalized to unseen data.

Finally, I saved the trained model's parameters for future use and deployed the classifier to make predictions on new images.

Overall, implementing the CNN classifier using the PyTorch library and the CIFAR-10 dataset was an exciting project that involved defining the network architecture, loading and preprocessing the data, training the model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for real-world predictions.
